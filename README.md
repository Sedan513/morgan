# AccessInvest

## Inspiration
Access to smart investing tools has too often been limited to the wealthy and well-connected. We believe that needs to change. AccessInvest was created to level the financial playing field, giving everyone — not just the elite — the power to manage their portfolios intelligently. With nearly 84% of high-income households owning stocks compared to just 29% of lower-income households, the gap in financial opportunity is undeniable. As a new generation steps into the world of investing, there is an urgent need to make financial literacy more accessible, understandable, and empowering. We were driven by a simple idea: building wealth shouldn’t be exclusive. It should be something that anyone can achieve with the right tools and information.
## What it does

AccessInvest is a platform that helps users manage and analyze their personal stock portfolios in real time. By entering their stocks, users receive immediate, AI-powered insights derived from SEC filings, current financial news, and live market trends. Instead of overwhelming them with complicated reports and jargon, AccessInvest translates complex data into simple, actionable insights. Our goal is to provide clarity and confidence, whether someone is a first-time investor or working to grow their financial future.

## How we built it
We built AccessInvest using a modern, lightweight technology stack to ensure speed, scalability, and simplicity. The frontend is designed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to deliver a clean, minimalistic user experience. MongoDB serves as our flexible database, while AWS powers our cloud backend, allowing us to handle real-time data processing efficiently. We integrated the Gemini API to pull in SEC filings and financial news, and applied AI summarization techniques to translate raw market data into easy-to-understand portfolio updates tailored to each user’s holdings.
